# AI Master Pro v6.1 - Absolute Trend Priority & Memory Management

The v6.1 update introduces critical refinements to the system's decision-making hierarchy and memory management. Based on deep analysis of market volatility, we have implemented **Absolute Dragon Priority**. This hard-coded rule ensures that during a "Dragon" trend (five or more consecutive identical results), the system strictly prioritizes the live trend over historical memory. Any memory-based correction that suggests a counter-trend move is automatically blocked, ensuring the AI stays aligned with the market's momentum until a clear breakout is detected.

To enhance transparency and debugging, we have added **Signal Correction Indicators** to the prediction output. The system now explicitly logs whether a signal was corrected by the Persistent Correction Table (PCT) or if a correction was blocked by an active trend. This allows both developers and users to understand the internal reasoning behind every signal, providing clear visibility into when the system is relying on historical memory versus live trend following.

Memory management has also been optimized with a new **Auto-Purge Mechanism**. To prevent the AI from relying on outdated or irrelevant historical data, the system now automatically expires and deletes any memory entries older than seven days. This ensures that the Persistent Correction Table remains fresh and focused on the most recent game server behaviors, reducing the risk of "memory clutter" affecting prediction accuracy.

| Feature | Update Description | Priority Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dragon Priority** | Absolute trend following during streaks | **Critical** |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Memory corrections blocked if counter-trend | **High** |
| **Signal Indicators** | `CORRECTED_BY_PCT` & `BLOCKED_BY_TREND` tags | **Medium** |
| **Memory Expiry** | 7-day rolling window for historical data | **Medium** |

These updates collectively create a more robust and transparent AI system that respects the raw power of market trends while still leveraging the intelligence of persistent historical learning.
