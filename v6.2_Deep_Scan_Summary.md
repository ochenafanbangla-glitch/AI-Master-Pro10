# AI MASTER PRO v6.2 - Deep Scan Update Summary

This update (v6.2) focuses on performance optimization, feature enhancement, and robust error handling as requested in the Deep Scan report.

## 1. Data Input Delay Removal (Urgent)
- **Change**: Removed the 2-second artificial delay in `app.py` that was preventing rapid manual data entry.
- **Impact**: Users can now input data as fast as they can click, with a minimal 0.1s debounce to prevent accidental double-clicks.

## 2. CVC Data Download Option (New Feature)
- **Change**: Added a "Download CVC Data" button on the dashboard.
- **Implementation**: Created a new API endpoint `/api/download-cvc` that generates a CSV file containing all trade data for the current session.
- **Usage**: Each session's data can now be exported for external analysis or record-keeping.

## 3. Logical Boundary Check & Database Locking
- **Fix**: Implemented `timeout=10` on all SQLite connections to prevent "Database is locked" errors during simultaneous read/write operations.
- **Optimization**: Enabled **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)** mode in SQLite for significantly better concurrency handling.
- **Dragon Logic**: Verified and reinforced the Dragon 5-to-4 period transition logic. Trend priority is maintained during active Dragon streaks to prevent conflicting memory corrections.

## 4. Exception Handling & Logging
- **Change**: Replaced all silent `except: pass` blocks with proper logging.
- **Implementation**: Integrated Python's `logging` module. All errors are now logged to `app_error.log` with full stack traces, making it easy to debug on PythonAnywhere.

## 5. Resource Management & Memory Optimization
- **Optimization**: Added a pattern limit (5000) in `model_a_core.py` to prevent memory bloat over long-running sessions.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing and connection pooling (via WAL mode).
- **Cleanup**: Ensured all database connections are explicitly closed in `finally` blocks.

## Technical Details
- **Version**: v6.2 (Deep Scan)
- **Core Engine**: Model A (Advanced Lite AI)
- **Managers**: CID Scanner, Risk Manager, Recovery Manager
- **Database**: SQLite (WAL Mode enabled)
- **Logging**: app_error.log
